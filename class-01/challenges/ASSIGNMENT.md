## Challenges

1. Check out a new branch in your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository.
1. Navigate into the `for-each` directory that you created in the setup assignment.
1. Create a file in this new directory named `challenges-01.test.js`.
1. Copy and paste the **entire content** of today's [code challenge](challenges-01.test.js){:target="_blank"} into the new file.
1. In your terminal, change to the folder for today's code challenge and run `npm test` to execute the tests in the file. At this point you will see the failed tests scroll through your terminal window with a brief report of the number of failed tests at the bottom. If you do not see this, verify your installation of Jest by typing `npx jest --version` in your terminal. Filename typos can make things break!
1. Write code to make the tests pass, one at a time. Let the error messages guide you.
1. Once the test is passing, refactor as needed, then move on to the next challenge.

## Submission
