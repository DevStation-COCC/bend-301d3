# Lab 05a: Extend Your Portfolio

## Overview

You will be adding new features to the portfolio project from lab 4. Work in the same repository on a new branch, remembering to add, commit, and push regularly.

When you have completed all of your features, make sure that your deployed application reflects the changes.

## Time Estimate

For each of the features listed below, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:

```
Number and name of feature: ________________________________

Estimate of time needed to complete: _____

Start time: _____

Finish time: _____

Actual time needed to complete: _____
```

Add this information to your README.

## User Acceptance Tests

### Feature #1: Add functionality

#### Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want to view a unique portfolio so that the developer's projects and skills stand out.

#### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user opens the application in the browser  
When the user navigates to the home page  
Then the portfolio contents should be displayed  

#### How are we implementing it?

- Complete the following features:
  - Use CDNs for content from libraries and remove the source code files from the project, as applicable
    - Note: CDNs are available for all libraries except Breakpoints.JS
  - In tablet view, show a fixed navigation menu instead of a hamburger menu
  - Convert the large image at the top of your portfolio to a video background or an image carousel containing at least three images
  - Add any other UI features that you feel will make your portfolio unique and personalized
