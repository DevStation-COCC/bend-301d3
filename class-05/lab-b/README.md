# Lab 05b: Responsive Web Design 

## Overview

In lab 1, you built a web page where each box of content was rendered with a unique color in desktop view and in mobile view. You will be completing this assignment again, using either Flexbox or CSS grids for styling.

Refer back to the lab 1 assignment details for a reminder of the problem domain. Deploy when done.

## Feature #1: Responsive design

### Why are we implementing this feature?

- As a user, I want the dimensions and colors of the application to change so that I can have a unique view in desktop, mobile, and tablet viewports.

### What are we going to implement?

Given that a user opens the application in the browser, on a tablet, or on a mobile device  
When the user changes the size of the viewport  
Then the boxes should scale proportionally and change colors  

### How are we implementing it?

- Use Flexbox or CSS grids for styling this application.
- Use relative units so the elements scale proportionally when the viewport dimensions change.
- Use at least two breakpoints and change the background colors of each box. There should be three possible views: desktop, tablet, and mobile device. You may choose the exact pixel values for each breakpoint.
